# (ABANDONED) 9-Cards Backend 

This is the source code of the 9-Cards backend application, a server-side, REST service application, 
that supports 9-Cards features for publishing and subscribing to Shared Collections.

9-Cards was an Android Launcher that organizes the applications and data of your phone into several collections.
It allowed the user to modify collections, create new collections, and share these collection with other users. 

9-Cards Version 2 was retired in early 2019. The source code is left here for those who may want to consult it and study it at will.
